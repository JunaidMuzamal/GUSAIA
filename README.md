## Running the Software

All the codes for building basic GUSAIA architecture can be found in `GUSAIA.py`. A pre-tarined model is also available as model.pth 
The file `GUSAIA.ipynb` explains how to train the GUSAIA architecture using a dataset, an example with  [[SWaT dataset](https://mlad.kaspersky.com/swat-testbed/)] is deployed
